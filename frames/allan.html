    Building a website with friends was an exciting adventure. We tackled challenges together, from brainstorming ideas to coding late into the night. Despite facing bugs and design hurdles, our teamwork and problem-solving skills carried us through. Celebrating milestones, like seeing our homepage take shape, strengthened our bond as friends. It was more than just creating a website; it was an unforgettable journey filled with laughter, shared frustrations, and moments of triumph.
